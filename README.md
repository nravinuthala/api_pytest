# api_pytest
1. Clone the repo into your system
2. Preferably create a pyton virtual env (python -m venv pytest_env) and switch to it.
3. Install prerequisites using the requirements.txt (python -m pip install -r requirements.txt)
4. Run pytest
5. pytest will automatically detect the test method and will run it, which in turn calls the method which makes the API call.
